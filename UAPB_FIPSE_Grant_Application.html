<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>UAPB Robotics Futures addresses Absolute Priority 2 by establishing a cross-state mentorship pipeline connecting University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff alumni with FIRST Robotics teams in St. Louis Public Schools (SLPS) and targeted Arkansas districts. The project targets the "AI Divide" by mobilizing HBCU alumni—professionals in engineering, CS, and education—to serve as technical mentors. Key activities include: (1) Developing an "AI Mentor Micro-credential" to train alumni in pedagogy and AI literacy; (2) Embedding AI/Computer Vision modules into the standard FIRST Robotics curriculum; (3) Providing professional development for K-12 teachers; and (4) Hosting a 4-week "UAPB AI & Robotics Bridge Institute" for high school participants. Over 48 months, the project will support 12 robotics teams annually, serving 400+ students, training 80 alumni mentors, and creating a replicable model for HBCU-led K-12 STEM engagement.</p>

<h1>PROJECT NARRATIVE</h1>

<div class="section-header">A. SIGNIFICANCE (30 Points)</div>

<h2>Addressing the AI Opportunity Gap</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the workforce, yet access to high-quality AI and Computer Science (CS) instruction remains inequitable. St. Louis Public Schools (SLPS) and rural Arkansas districts serve student populations that are historically underrepresented in STEM. While many of these schools attempt to field FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) or FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams, they often lack the technical mentorship required to move beyond basic mechanics into advanced computing, specifically AI, machine learning, and autonomous programming.</p>

<h2>The UAPB Solution: Culturally Responsive Mentorship</h2>
<p>This project is significant because it activates an untapped resource: the UAPB Alumni Network. St. Louis is a major hub for UAPB graduates. By training these alumni—who share lived experiences with the students—to serve as "AI Robotics Mentors," we solve two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Technical Gap:</strong> Alumni provide the expertise needed to teach students how to program robots using AI (e.g., computer vision for object detection).</li>
<li><strong>The Representation Gap:</strong> Students see successful Black engineers and technologists, directly influencing their postsecondary aspirations.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Magnitude of Results</h2>
<p>This project moves beyond "exposure." By integrating AI literacy into the competitive ecosystem of FIRST Robotics, students apply AI concepts to solve tangible problems. This creates a direct pipeline from 8th grade through high school graduation, leading to increased enrollment in CS/AI programs at UAPB and peer institutions.</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<div class="section-header">B. QUALITY OF THE PROJECT DESIGN (45 Points)</div>

<p>The project is designed around four distinct activity pillars:</p>

<h2>Activity 1: The Alumni AI Mentor Corps (Train the Trainer)</h2>
<p>UAPB will recruit cohorts of 20 alumni annually (80 total). Before entering schools, mentors will complete a 20-hour "AI & Pedagogy Micro-credential" developed by UAPB Computer Science faculty.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum:</strong> How to teach AI ethics, explaining neural networks to 14-year-olds, and fostering "Computational Thinking."</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A certified workforce of volunteer mentors capable of translating high-level tech to K-12 students.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Activity 2: AI-Infused Robotics Support (School Year)</h2>
<p>Mentors are matched with robotics teams in SLPS and Arkansas. Support is hybrid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly Virtual Code Reviews:</strong> Mentors review student code (Java/Python) via Zoom, specifically focusing on autonomous modes and sensor integration.</li>
<li><strong>On-Site Build Days:</strong> Mentors travel to schools monthly during "Build Season" (Jan-March) to assist with complex systems.</li>
<li><strong>The AI Challenge:</strong> Teams will be tasked with integrating a specific AI component (e.g., using a Limelight camera for vision tracking) regardless of competition requirements, ensuring AI learning occurs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Activity 3: Teacher Professional Development</h2>
<p>Consistent with Priority 2(f), UAPB will partner with SLPS and Arkansas LEAs to provide summer PD workshops for the teachers/coaches leading these teams.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong> "From Blocks to Python: Integrating AI in the Classroom."</li>
<li><strong>Resource:</strong> Teachers receive a "Robotics AI Toolkit" with lesson plans mapped to state CS standards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Activity 4: The UAPB AI & Robotics Bridge Institute (Summer)</h2>
<p>A 4-week residential summer program at the UAPB campus for rising high school juniors/seniors selected from the supported teams.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content:</strong> Advanced AI coursework, college prep, and a "Robot-in-3-Days" style design challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Solidify the pathway from high school robotics to UAPB matriculation.</li>
</ul>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<div class="section-header">C. QUALITY OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN (10 Points)</div>

<h2>Governance Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Director (Director of Admissions, 25% FTE):</strong> Responsible for overall strategy, alumni recruitment, and SLPS partnership management.</li>
<li><strong>Program Coordinator (100% FTE):</strong> A full-time hire responsible for day-to-day logistics, mentor background checks, travel coordination, and purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Faculty Lead (Computer Science, Release Time):</strong> Oversees the academic integrity of the AI curriculum and Mentor Micro-credential.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steering Committee</h2>
<p>A quarterly committee comprising UAPB faculty, SLPS Office of College & Career Readiness, and Alumni Association leadership will review progress.</p>

<h2>Timeline – Key Milestones</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Recruit initial 20 mentors; Develop Micro-credential; Launch support for 8 Pilot Teams (4 MO, 4 AR).</li>
<li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Expand to 12 teams; Launch Summer Bridge Institute (Cohort 1).</li>
<li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Full scale (12 teams); Refine AI Toolkit based on Year 1-2 data.</li>
<li><strong>Year 4:</strong> Evaluation and publication of the "HBCU Robotics Mentorship Playbook."</li>
</ul>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<div class="section-header">D. QUALITY OF THE PROJECT EVALUATION (15 Points)</div>

<p>UAPB will contract an independent external evaluator to conduct a mixed-methods evaluation.</p>

<h2>Performance Measures & Targets</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI Literacy Gains:</strong> 80% of participating students will show a 0.5 Standard Deviation increase on the validated AI Literacy Scale (Long & Magerko) pre/post-season.</li>
<li><strong>Mentor Efficacy:</strong> 90% of alumni mentors will complete the micro-credential and report increased confidence in teaching STEM concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Postsecondary Intent:</strong> 75% of graduating seniors in the program will apply to a STEM or AI-related postsecondary program.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Successfully support 12 teams annually by Year 2.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
<p>Evaluation data (surveys, robotics performance data) will be reviewed after every "Build Season" (April) to adjust the Summer Bridge curriculum and Mentor Training for the following fall.</p>
