            <h3>Learning Objectives:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify Core Digital Citizenship Concepts: Define and distinguish between digital footprints, online privacy, cybersecurity threats, and netiquette principles.</li>
                <li>Analyze Digital Risks: Identify potential privacy violations, security threats, and inappropriate online behaviors in simulated digital environments.</li>
                <li>Develop Responsible Technology Guidelines: Collaboratively create classroom technology norms for respectful communication and responsible device usage.</li>

            <div class="point">
                <div class="point-title">Interactive eLearning Module</div>
                <div>Students begin with a self-paced module created in a tool like Articulate Storyline. This module introduces key vocabulary (digital footprint, privacy, cybersecurity, netiquette, phishing) through a series of short, engaging videos and animated explainers. To ensure active processing, each concept is followed by a quick check-for-understanding, such as a multiple-choice question or a drag-and-drop activity. This pre-training approach, informed by Cognitive Load Theory, ensures students have the necessary schema before moving to more complex tasks.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                <div class="point-title">Gamified Simulation: "Digital Footprint Detective"</div>
                <div>In this scenario-based game, students analyze a fictional student's social media profile (a mock "FriendBook" page). They must identify specific posts that could compromise privacy (e.g., a photo showing a house number), instances of poor netiquette, and potential phishing scams in direct messages. Clicking on a problematic element reveals an explanation of the risk, providing immediate, contextualized feedback. The goal is to find all the "clues" and earn a "Digital Citizen" badge, making learning engaging and intrinsically motivating.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                <div class="point-title">Collaborative Charter: "Classroom Tech Norms"</div>
                <div>Using Microsoft Whiteboard within Teams, students work in small groups to brainstorm and draft a "Classroom Tech Norms" charter. They answer prompts like, "What does respectful online communication look like?" and "How can we responsibly use our devices in this class?" This co-creation process, rooted in Social Constructivism, fosters a sense of ownership and community, establishing a shared foundation for a respectful digital environment for the rest of the course. The teacher facilitates a final whole-class discussion to synthesize the group charters into a single class-wide agreement.</div>
