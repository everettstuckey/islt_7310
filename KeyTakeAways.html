                    My passion for integrating applied skills and academic curriculum has been
                    driven by my academic background and professional experiences.<span
                        style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>My journey, thus far, has been extensively shaped
                    by the deep commitment I harbor for education and empowering students with
                    practical skills. I pursued my undergraduate degree in finance and have had
                    work experience as an investment banker and a consultant, both of which have
                    continually honed my analytical skills and strengthened my foundation in data
                    analysis, which I <span class=GramE>put to use</span> later as a school
                    counselor. In that role, I designed and led the implementation of programming
                    to integrate CTE skills into the academic curriculum, with a focus on project
                    management, coding, and data analysis. </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="color: white;">I believe that all students have the right to equitable
                    and accessible education, regardless of their background. My values are
                    committed to social justice, equity, and that practical skills are necessary
                    for student success. The latter defined my work and have guided my passion
                    for integrating CTE skills in academic curricula.<span
                        style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I believe in the transformative impact of
                    the access to and efficient organization of information.<span
                        style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>My desire to further pursue research in
                    Information Science and Learning Technologies is due to the ability of this
                    field of research to overcome structural inequity. To be precise, I am
                    interested in the ways in which the educational outcomes and the success of
                    the students have been and can be improved <span class=GramE>through the use
                        of</span> data analytics to support and enhance learning teachers, students
                    and parents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It is the significant of
                    this opportunity that motivated interest in graduate study in the Learning
                    Technology and Design <span class=SpellE>EdS</span> program, and I greatly
                    wish to continue to this work at the doctoral level. </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="color: white;">In my role as a School <span class=GramE>Counselor</span>
                    I have assisted in the preparation of McKinley CLAs Department of Education
                    Career Z Challenge Grant, resulting in the receipt of $10,000 for technology
                    related Work based Learning. We are in consideration for an additional
                    $150,00 for from the Department of Education.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                    </span>The grant includes a systemic approach starting from a Computer
                    Literacy course in grade 9, progressing through various career exploration
                    activities and internships in higher grades, and involving partnerships with
                    organizations such as Amazon, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and the Danforth Plant
                    Science Center. Measurable outcomes and sustainability efforts are outlined,
                    including metrics for student <span class=GramE>participation</span> and
                    learning gains, and a fundraising campaign to support the program. The
                    initiative seeks to enhance technological proficiency <span class=GramE>in
                        order to</span> prepare students for internships and enrichment opportunities
                    and thereby increase post-secondary attainment and persistence. Mastery of
                    essential technological skills is an integral component of exposing <span
                        class=GramE>students<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>to</span>
                    real-world experiences, preparing them for future careers and promoting
                    educational equity.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="color: white;">I believe continuing to develop my methodological skill
                    sets will assist me my efforts of implementing and evaluating the integration
                    of Data Science, Analytics and Career and Technical Education into the
