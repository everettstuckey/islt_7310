<h1>APPENDIX D: EVALUATION INSTRUMENTS</h1>

<div class="instrument">
<h2>INSTRUMENT 1: AI LITERACY SCALE</h2>

<h3>Source and Validation</h3>
<p>Long, D., & Magerko, B. (2020). "What is AI Literacy? Competencies and Design Considerations." <em>Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>, 1-16. DOI: 10.1145/3313831.3376727</p>

<p>This validated instrument measures five core competencies of AI literacy: (1) What is AI?, (2) What Can AI Do?, (3) How Does AI Work?, (4) How Should AI Be Used?, and (5) How Do People Perceive AI? The scale has demonstrated strong reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.89) across diverse populations.</p>

<h3>Administration Protocol</h3>
<p><strong>Pre-Test:</strong> Administered at the beginning of the robotics season (September) to all participating students<br>
<strong>Post-Test:</strong> Administered at the conclusion of the robotics season (April) using identical items<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 20-25 minutes<br>
<strong>Format:</strong> Online survey via Qualtrics</p>

<h3>Sample Items</h3>

<p class="item"><strong>Domain 1: What is AI?</strong></p>
<p><em>Rate your agreement with the following statements on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree):</em></p>

□ I can give examples of AI technologies that I use in my everyday life.<br>
□ I understand the difference between AI and regular computer programs.
</div>

<p class="item"><strong>Domain 2: What Can AI Do?</strong></p>
<p><em>Rate your agreement (1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree):</em></p>
<div class="scale">
□ I can describe at least three tasks that AI systems can perform.<br>
□ I understand the limitations of what current AI can and cannot do.<br>
□ I can identify situations where AI would be more effective than humans.
</div>

<p class="item"><strong>Domain 3: How Does AI Work?</strong></p>
<p><em>Rate your agreement (1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree):</em></p>
<div class="scale">
□ I understand how AI systems learn from data.<br>
□ I can explain what a "neural network" is in simple terms.<br>
□ I understand how training data affects AI system performance.
</div>

<p class="item"><strong>Domain 4: How Should AI Be Used?</strong></p>

<div class="scale">
□ I can identify ethical issues that might arise from using AI.<br>
□ I understand what "algorithmic bias" means.<br>
□ I can explain why fairness is important in AI design.
</div>

<p class="item"><strong>Domain 5: How Do People Perceive AI?</strong></p>
<p><em>Rate your agreement (1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree):</em></p>
<div class="scale">
□ I understand why some people are excited about AI while others are concerned.<br>
□ I can explain common misconceptions about AI.<br>
□ I have thought about how AI might affect my future career.
</div>

<p class="note"><em>Note: The full validated instrument contains 25 items across the five domains. Scoring is calculated as the mean response across items within each domain, with an overall AI Literacy score computed as the average of the five domain scores. A 0.5 standard deviation increase (approximately 0.5 points on the 5-point scale) represents educationally significant growth.</em></p>
