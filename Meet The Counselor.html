          <h2>Meet the Counselor</h2>
          <p>My name is Everett Stuckey, and I am the 9th and 10th grade Counselor at Collegiate School of Medicine and Bioscience. Currently, I am an EdS candidate in the school of Information Science and Learning Technologies at the University of Missouri. I attended the Masters of Arts in Counseling program at Lindenwood University and received my Bachelors of Science in Finance from Indiana University where I was a Herman B Wells Scholar, receiving a scholarship for full tuition room board and stipend. Having the opportunity to complete undergraduate and graduate school without any student debt was achievable for me and I believe I can help any student do the same.</p>
          <p>I previously worked as the High School Counselor at McKinley Classical Leadership Academy in SLPS and in the East Saint Louis School district for the Wraparound Wellness Program and completing my internship hours at Lincoln Middle School and East Saint Louis Senior High. Before working in education, I had the opportunity to put my finance degree to use working in investment banking for Goldman Sachs and Duetsche Bank in New York.</p>
          <p>In my free time I play soccer, chess and read. I also continue to dabble in finance, trading derivatives and building financial models. (this is what I consider to be “fun”) Come see me about starting a Finance Club!</p>
          <p>My goal is to help students achieve their full potential by providing guidance, resources, and support. I am passionate about education and committed to making a positive impact on my students' lives.</p>
          <p>I relaxed on my summer vacation supporting a pilot internship program and teaching a course on Data Analytics and Digital Media in the IT &amp; Cybersecurity Summer Academy.</p>

    <section id="reflection" class="section section-reflection">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Reflection Statement</h2>
        <h3>Section 1: Entering the Program</h3>
        <p>
          When I entered the ISLT program, I brought a unique blend of counseling expertise and quantitative training. My background in finance and experience as a high school counselor gave me a strong foundation in systems thinking, data literacy, and student advocacy. However, my technology practice was pragmatic rather than systematic—I made tools work as needed for students, but I lacked a comprehensive framework for designing technology-enhanced instruction, measuring impact, and scaling what worked. I chose ISLT to deepen my capacity to design equitable, data-informed learning experiences and to lead technology integration that is thoughtful, ethical, and sustainable in real school contexts.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 2: Three Significant Learnings and Representative Artifacts</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Designing for accessibility and clarity improves outcomes for all learners.</strong>
            I learned to center accessibility, readability, and consistency in every web-based resource. By applying semantic HTML, high-contrast color schemes, and responsive layouts, I reduced cognitive load and made content easier to navigate for students and families using varied devices and bandwidth. 
            Representative artifact: 
            <a href="https://everettstuckey.github.io/islt_7310/elearning/digital_literacy_curriculum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Literacy Curriculum</a> — a resource structured for clarity and ease of use, demonstrating accessible design choices and alignment to learner goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rapid prototyping accelerates feedback cycles and learning gains.</strong>
            Using rapid development approaches, I built and iterated instructional materials at speed, incorporating feedback from students and peers. Low-code tools and structured design sprints enabled me to test assumptions quickly and surface usability issues early, leading to better engagement. 
            Representative artifacts: 
            <a href="https://everettstuckey.github.io/IS_LT-7383/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapid Development Tools Portfolio</a> and 
            <a href="https://everettstuckey.github.io/IS_LT-7383/slideshows/Financial%20Markets%20Slide%20Show.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Markets Slideshow</a> — both illustrate iterative multimedia design with clear learning objectives and formative checks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data-informed decision-making strengthens instructional impact.</strong>
            I refined skills in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting learning data to guide interventions. From simple clickstream measures and completion rates to rubric-aligned performance and reflection artifacts, I learned to select appropriate indicators and close the loop by adjusting instruction and supports. This approach sustains improvement and promotes transparency with stakeholders. 
            Representative artifact: The analytics and reflection components embedded across the Rapid Development artifacts above, which informed subsequent revisions and targeted supports.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Section 3: Impact on My Practice</h3>
        <p>
          The ISLT program has transformed how I design, facilitate, and evaluate student learning experiences. I now approach problems with a structured design mindset, prototype early, and use evidence to iterate quickly. My counseling practice benefits from clearer communication artifacts, better resource navigation, and data practices that protect students while illuminating where support is most needed. Going forward, I will continue to lead technology-enhanced initiatives grounded in equity, accessibility, and measurable outcomes—helping students chart debt-free pathways to postsecondary opportunities and empowering colleagues with practical, tested resources. ISLT has equipped me to be not just a resource curator, but a designer of learning.
