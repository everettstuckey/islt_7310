<h2>21. What is your innovation?</h2>
<p>Math-in-Motion is a 6-week in-person “Simulated Workplace” summer academy where Algebra and Geometry are mastered through hands-on construction builds at the Building Futures STL community workshop in the Old North neighborhood of St. Louis. Students in grades 7–11 engage in real-world projects-framing utility sheds, wiring residential circuits, balancing HVAC airflow, and deploying drones-while certified math teachers and experienced tradespeople co-teach every session. The program targets North St. Louis youth who face a critical “math slide” between grades 7 and 9, providing them with a Workforce Numeracy Certificate and a $1,000 training-wage stipend upon completion.</p>

<h2>22. How does your program offer a bold, new approach to career-connected learning?</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional remedial summer school programs that repeat failed classroom approaches, Math-in-Motion reimagines math instruction as employer-co-designed production within an authentic workplace environment. The program’s central innovation is a co-teaching model that pairs certified math teachers with journey-level tradespeople in every session-a pairing that has no precedent in the St. Louis region. Community assets, including experienced tradespeople and the Building Futures Workshop facility, transform math instruction from abstract to contextual, high-safety, and career-connected. Students do not sit in classrooms solving textbook problems. Instead, they “clock in” with digital ID badges, receive PPE, and complete technical work orders that require precise mathematical calculations-tolerances of ±1/32” for framing, Ohm’s Law calculations for electrical circuits, and CFM equations for HVAC balancing. Peer inspections replace traditional tests, and quality assurance rubrics measure both technical accuracy and mathematical precision. The program directly addresses the “Cognitive Disconnect” identified in situated cognition research: when urban youth encounter abstract algebra without utilitarian context, they disengage. By embedding Algebra and Geometry into high-stakes, real-world builds, Math-in-Motion makes mathematical mastery a functional workplace requirement rather than an academic exercise. Students earn a Workforce Numeracy Certificate and a $1,000 training-wage stipend that validates their contributions as emerging professionals, while building the applied numeracy skills that employers in construction, electrical, HVAC, and advanced manufacturing consistently identify as their most critical hiring gap in the St. Louis regional labor market.</p>

<h2>23. What makes it innovative or different from existing programs?</h2>
<p>No existing program in St. Louis-or the broader Midwest-pairs certified math teachers with journey-level tradespeople in a co-teaching model where Algebra and Geometry are taught through hands-on skilled trades projects. Current remedial programs simply repeat failed classroom approaches; Math-in-Motion fundamentally restructures who teaches, where learning happens, and how mastery is measured. The Simulated Workplace format replaces the traditional classroom with an authentic job-site environment. Students clock in using digital ID badges, wear PPE, complete technical work orders, and undergo peer inspections-all while mastering specific Missouri Learning Standards in Algebra I and Geometry. This addresses the Cognitive Disconnect that situated cognition research identifies as the primary cause of urban youth disengagement from abstract math instruction. Three additional innovations distinguish this program. First, the co-teaching training institute requires all 16 instructors to complete 40 hours of cross-disciplinary preparation before the academy begins, ensuring tradespeople learn inquiry-based pedagogy and math teachers learn blueprint reading and structural calculations. Second, the program uses heterogeneous grouping rather than ability tracking, which research shows exacerbates achievement gaps in Midwestern urban schools. Third, the “Work Order” assessment format replaces traditional tests with technical documents that students must calculate, verify, and defend during peer inspections. No other program in this region combines mathematical rigor with authentic workplace culture in a community-based setting specifically designed for youth who have been failed by conventional instruction.</p>

<h2>24. What specific challenge or need does your program aim to address?</h2>
<p>In Saint Louis City, Algebra I failure excludes students from 80 percent of high-wage career pathways. In zip code 63106, the Algebra I failure rate reaches 62 percent. Between grades 7 and 9, math proficiency among Saint Louis City students drops from 42 percent to just 14 percent-a precipitous “math slide”-while student interest in skilled trades remains above 70 percent. This disconnect effectively disqualifies minority youth from technical careers by age 15, perpetuating generational poverty across North St. Louis. The socioeconomic data underscores the urgency. In zip codes 63106 and 63107, poverty rates exceed 42 percent, adult unemployment hovers near 17 percent, and access to technical training is critically low. According to the St. Louis Regional Workforce Strategy Group, 65 percent of minority students expressing interest in vocational pathways are disqualified by sub-proficient numeracy scores by age 15. Two-thirds of community college entrants require remedial math, a burden falling disproportionately on Black and Latine learners from low-income backgrounds. The economic cost is staggering: each student who fails Algebra I faces a projected lifetime earnings loss exceeding $400,000 compared to peers who enter trade apprenticeships. Math-in-Motion directly targets this crisis by reconnecting mathematical instruction to the career interests these students already possess, transforming math from a gatekeeper into a gateway. The program addresses both the academic deficit and the identity crisis that drives disengagement, providing a concrete on-ramp to high-wage technical careers for youth who would otherwise be permanently excluded from the regional skilled workforce pipeline.</p>

<h2>25. What outcomes do you expect to see?</h2>
<p>Math-in-Motion targets five measurable outcomes that directly improve career-connected learning for participants. First, 85 percent of participants will demonstrate at least one grade level of growth in applied numeracy as measured by pre- and post-program assessments embedded in technical work orders aligned to Missouri Learning Standards. Second, the program aims for a 40 percent reduction in the number of participants requiring non-credit remedial math upon entering technical programs or community colleges. Third, 90 percent of at-risk Algebra I students will earn a C or better in their next academic math course the following school year, demonstrating sustained learning transfer from the Simulated Workplace back to the traditional classroom. Fourth, 80 percent of Grade 10–11 participants will achieve passing scores on Mock Trade Entrance Exams, validating career-readiness competencies recognized by the Construction Career Development Initiative (CCDI) and Construction Forum STL. Fifth, 100 percent of completers will earn the Workforce Numeracy Certificate and digital badge validated by Harris-Stowe State University, with Grade 10-11 participants eligible to enroll in HSSU dual-credit statistics coursework (STAT0260: Data Analysis & Statistics with Lab), earning up to 4 transfer-ready college credits. These outcomes collectively translate to an estimated $1.5 million aggregate increase in starting wages for the cohort, as each student entering a trade apprenticeship gains projected lifetime earnings exceeding $1.2 million above peers in low-skill service sectors. Beyond individual impact, the program will double Saint Louis City youth entering apprenticeship pipelines and generate evaluation data on co-teaching effectiveness to inform replication across other urban districts.</p>

<h2>26. What metrics will you use to measure progress?</h2>
<p>The program employs both quantitative and qualitative metrics to measure progress and determine effectiveness. Quantitative metrics include: math unit mastery scores embedded in weekly work orders aligned to Missouri Learning Standards; pre- and post-program numeracy assessments measuring grade-level growth; OSHA-10 certification completion rates; industry pre-apprentice module pass rates; punctual clock-in attendance tracked through the digital attendance system; dual-credit completion rates for eligible participants; stipended hours completed; and post-program tracking of apprenticeship entry and advanced math enrollment at six and twelve months. Qualitative metrics include: learner surveys measuring STEM identity, sense of belonging, and career self-efficacy administered at program entry, midpoint, and conclusion; co-teaching efficacy tool scores completed weekly by each teacher-tradesperson pair to assess collaboration quality and instructional alignment; family engagement participation rates including Math-at-Home toolkit usage and Parent Apprenticeship Seminar attendance; and student portfolio assessments documenting applied mathematics skills through project-based work. An external evaluation partner from the Center for Urban Education and Policy at the University of Missouri-St. Louis will conduct classroom observations using a structured rubric, interview students and instructors, and analyze longitudinal data. Weekly data reviews by the program coordinator enable real-time instructional adjustments. The combination of embedded formative assessments within work orders and summative evaluation tools ensures the program can identify what is working in real time and make mid-course corrections while generating the rigorous evidence base needed for Catalyze Phase 2 and Phase 3 consideration and for broader dissemination to other urban districts.</p>

<h2>27. Who are the learners you intend to serve?</h2>
<p>Math-in-Motion serves 20–30 Saint Louis City middle and high school students (grades 7–11) from North St. Louis, prioritizing Black and Latine youth residing in zip codes 63106, 63107, 63113, and 63115-neighborhoods where poverty rates exceed 35 percent and technical training access is critically low. These students possess strong interest in skilled trades (above 70 percent) but face a systemic math proficiency decline that excludes them from career pathways by age 15. The program meets their specific needs through several intentional design features. Heterogeneous pods of students mirror industrial work crews, avoiding the rigid ability tracking that research shows exacerbates achievement gaps. A bilingual Math-at-Home toolkit (English/Spanish) extends learning to family contexts and validates the multilingual assets students bring. Transportation, daily meals, and training-wage stipends ($1,000 per student) remove economic barriers to participation. Trauma-informed coaching embedded in the co-teaching model ensures a psychologically safe learning environment where mistakes are treated as engineering iterations rather than academic failures. The program builds on student strengths by honoring the intergenerational craft knowledge present in their communities. Students are paired with tradespeople of color who serve as “identity anchors,” providing the “skilled technician” persona that counters academic disidentification in mathematics. Students directly influence rotation choices, safety roles, inspection rubrics, and project catalog selections, ensuring they have genuine agency in shaping the program experience rather than being passive recipients of instruction designed without their input or cultural context.</p>

<h2>28. How will learners be meaningfully engaged in design, execution, and assessment?</h2>
<p>Learners from historically underserved backgrounds are positioned as co-creators, not passive participants, throughout every phase of the program. During design, a youth advisory panel drawn from North St. Louis neighborhoods provides input on the project catalog, selecting which builds and rotations will be offered and recommending modifications based on peer interest and community relevance. During execution, students participate in weekly “toolbox talk” retrospectives where they evaluate what worked, propose changes, and set goals for the following week-mirroring the continuous improvement practices used on professional job sites. Students exercise meaningful agency through multiple channels: choosing their rotation sequences based on personal career interests, assuming rotating safety officer roles within their work crews, and co-developing the peer inspection rubrics used to assess work quality. This voice-and-choice structure ensures the program reflects learner aspirations rather than imposing external assumptions about what disadvantaged youth need. During assessment, students defend their mathematical reasoning during peer inspections and contribute to portfolio documentation of their growth. The program intentionally employs “identity anchors” by pairing students with journey-level tradespeople of color who share their backgrounds and neighborhoods. This reduces academic disidentification-the internalized belief that they are “not math people”-by providing visible proof that mathematical mastery leads to respected, high-wage careers. The “skilled technician” persona replaces the traditional “student” identity, removing the stereotype threat that depresses math performance in conventional classroom settings and building durable STEM identity rooted in authentic professional competence.</p>

<h2>29. Who are the partners you will involve?</h2>
<p>Harris-Stowe State University (HSSU) serves as the institutional anchor, providing program oversight from a campus rooted in the history of Black academic innovation in the St. Louis region. HSSU contributes curriculum coordination aligned to Missouri Learning Standards, evaluation infrastructure, student data management through its institutional research office, and dual-credit pathways for eligible participants. HSSU faculty support the co-teaching training institute and provide advanced dual-credit statistics instruction (Data Analysis & Statistics with Lab), giving eligible participants transfer-ready college credits using R programming and applied data science. Building Futures STL is the primary community partner, providing the workshop facility at 2720 N. 13th Street in the Old North neighborhood, fabrication tools and construction materials, hands-on project coordination, and industry mentors drawn from the local trades community. Building Futures’ expertise in youth-centered project-based learning makes them the operational hub for the Simulated Workplace model. Schools in Saint Louis City contribute student recruitment through school counselors, transportation coordination, academic records integration, and follow-up support during the subsequent school year to track learning transfer. Industry partners-specifically the Construction Career Development Initiative (CCDI, ccdi.org/st-louis) and Construction Forum STL (constructforstl.org)-provide journey-level tradespeople as co-teaching mentors, validate workforce competencies for apprenticeship entrance credit, and donate in-kind materials and access to active job sites for student field visits. Emerson, a St. Louis-based industrial technology company, advises on digital twin and CAD integration for the program’s technology components. The Center for Urban Education and Policy at the University of Missouri-St. Louis provides external evaluation expertise and longitudinal data analysis capacity.</p>

<h2>30. How will these partnerships strengthen the impact of your program?</h2>
<p>Each partnership amplifies impact in ways no single organization could achieve alone. Building Futures embeds authentic workplace needs into every hands-on project, ensuring that mathematical tasks reflect real industry standards-tolerances, safety calculations, material estimations-rather than artificial textbook exercises. Their deep roots in the Old North neighborhood give the program cultural legitimacy and trust that an external institution could not provide, which is essential for recruiting and retaining families who have reason to distrust educational interventions. HSSU brings academic rigor, institutional credibility, and evaluation capacity. Their oversight ensures the program meets Missouri Learning Standards while their institutional research office provides the data management infrastructure needed for longitudinal tracking of student outcomes. The HSSU campus also serves as a visible connection between the summer academy and higher education pathways, expanding student aspirations beyond immediate career entry. Industry partners-CCDI and Construction Forum STL-validate that program competencies align with actual apprenticeship entrance requirements, giving students tangible workforce credentials rather than symbolic certificates. Journey-level tradespeople mentoring in the program demonstrate that mathematical mastery translates directly to respected, high-wage careers, providing the identity anchors that research shows are critical for sustained engagement among underserved youth. The combination of a community-based nonprofit, an HBCU, a public school district, and industry workforce partners creates a coalition that addresses every dimension of the challenge: technical skills, academic standards, workforce readiness, cultural relevance, and equitable access-a partnership model designed for replication across other urban contexts.</p>

<h2>31. What resources do you anticipate needing?</h2>
<p>Successful implementation requires resources across six categories. Personnel: compensation for 8 certified math teachers and 8 journey-level tradespeople serving as co-teaching pairs, plus a program coordinator, data manager, and site safety officer. The 40-hour co-teaching training institute preceding the academy requires additional facilitator support and substitute coverage for participating teachers. Student supports: training-wage stipends ($1,000 per student for the full 6-week program), daily transportation to and from the Building Futures workshop, daily meals, and personal protective equipment (hard hats, safety glasses, work gloves, steel-toed boots) for each participant. Facility and materials: workshop access at Building Futures STL, including fabrication space, power tools, hand tools, and construction consumables such as lumber, electrical wire, PVC piping, and HVAC ductwork. Weekly material replenishment is required given the hands-on nature of the builds. Technology: CAD-capable tablets for digital blueprinting and 3D modeling, DJI Tello drones for the logistics deployment rotation, software licenses for digital twin simulations, and the digital clock-in system hardware and software. Evaluation: external evaluation support from the Center for Urban Education and Policy at UMSL to conduct classroom observations, analyze pre- and post-assessment data, interview participants, and produce the evidence base required for Phase 2 advancement. Administrative: liability and participant insurance coverage, dual-credit tuition agreements with HSSU covering both workforce numeracy credentials and advanced statistics coursework (STAT0260 and MATH0301), digital badging platform fees, bilingual Math-at-Home toolkit printing and distribution costs, and a contingency fund for unexpected equipment replacement during the academy.</p>

<h2>32. Do you currently have these resources?</h2>
<p>Core partnerships are secured and operational. Building Futures STL has committed workshop facility access and fabrication tools at no cost to the program. HSSU provides institutional infrastructure for fiscal management, IRB oversight, and data systems. Industry partners (CCDI and Construction Forum STL) have committed journey-level tradespeople as co-teaching mentors and will donate in-kind construction materials and job-site access for field visits. These in-kind commitments represent approximately $45,000 in contributed value. Phase 1 Catalyze funding ($10,000) supports planning and design activities including the co-teaching training institute curriculum development, detailed work order creation aligned to Missouri Learning Standards, partnership formalization through memoranda of understanding, and initial evaluation framework design. Phase 2 funding ($50,000) would support the pilot launch including instructor compensation, student stipends, and consumable materials. Phase 3 funding (up to $300,000) would cover full-scale implementation costs including technology infrastructure, comprehensive evaluation, and program expansion. Remaining resource gaps include: a formal evaluation partnership (we are pursuing a collaboration with the Center for Urban Education and Policy at the University of Missouri-St. Louis), transportation logistics and funding (seeking support from local foundations including the Emerson Charitable Trust and the Regional Arts Commission), PPE procurement for the initial cohort, and a tooling contingency fund for equipment replacement during the academy. We are also pursuing Missouri STEM Hub grants for technology components (tablets, drones, software) and have initiated conversations with Emerson regarding corporate sponsorship of digital twin and CAD components.</p>

<h2>33. How does your program create hands-on, student-driven learning experiences?</h2>
<p>Each week of the six-week academy immerses students in a different industry rotation where mathematical concepts are learned through completing real construction projects. In Week 1, students master fraction-to-decimal conversion and precision measurement using steel rules, calipers, and micrometers while completing a benchmarking layout project with tolerances of ±1/32 inch. Week 2 centers on framing a utility shed, where students apply the Pythagorean Theorem for rafter calculations and board-foot equations for material estimation. Week 3 introduces residential circuit integration using Ohm’s Law and linear equations to wire parallel and series circuits with multimeters and conduit benders. Week 4 covers hydraulic flow and PVC irrigation using volume and flow rate calculations. Week 5 focuses on HVAC airflow balancing through CFM calculations and thermal variable analysis. Week 6 culminates in logistics drone deployment requiring coordinate planes, vectors, and rate-time-distance equations. Throughout every rotation, students drive their own learning. They “clock in” daily using digital ID badges, wear full PPE, receive mathematical tasks formatted as professional work orders, and conduct peer inspections using rubrics they helped design. The entire experience is student-driven-learners calculate material needs, verify measurements, defend their mathematical reasoning during inspections, and iterate designs when tolerances are not met. No projects are pre-built or demonstrated; students must reason through each challenge collaboratively within their work crews, building both mathematical competence and the professional communication skills essential for career success in the skilled trades.</p>

<h2>34. How will your program support learners in understanding their career options?</h2>
<p>Math-in-Motion builds career understanding through multiple integrated mechanisms. At program entry, intake surveys assess each student’s career interests, learning preferences, and prior exposure to technical work, enabling personalized rotation sequencing that aligns with individual aspirations. Students explore six distinct industry sectors across the academy-construction, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, logistics and drone technology, and digital fabrication-gaining direct experience with the mathematical demands and daily realities of each career pathway. Weekly Lunch and Learn mentorship sessions pair students with experienced tradespeople who share their personal career journeys, describing how they use specific math concepts daily and what pathways led them from entry-level positions to journey-level expertise. These mentors of color serve as identity anchors, demonstrating that young people from their own neighborhoods and backgrounds have built respected, financially secure careers through technical mastery. This directly counters the intimidation and academic disidentification that prevent many underserved youth from pursuing technical fields. Field visits to active job sites coordinated through CCDI and Construction Forum STL give students firsthand exposure to professional work environments and the scale of projects they could eventually lead. Upon completion, students earn a digital badge and Workforce Numeracy Certificate validated by HSSU that signals career readiness to employers and apprenticeship programs. Industry partners recognize program competencies for entrance credit, creating a direct pipeline from the academy into registered apprenticeships. For academically advanced participants, HSSU dual-credit statistics courses provide an additional pathway, equipping students with data analysis and R programming skills valued across construction management, engineering, and emerging technology sectors.</p>

<div class="section-header">PROJECT ABSTRACT</div>

<p>The HSSU & Saint Louis City "Math-in-Motion" Summer Academy is an innovative workforce readiness program designed to arrest the "math slide" among Saint Louis City Youth. By targeting students in grades 7-11, the project reimagines the traditional summer school model as a "Simulated Workplace" where mathematics is taught through the lens of skilled trades. In partnership with Harris-Stowe State University (HSSU) and Building Futures STL, schools in Saint Louis City will employ a co-teaching model pairing certified math teachers with experienced tradespeople. This single-summer pilot program will launch in Summer 2027 with an initial cohort of 20-30 students from the City of St. Louis, providing them with a "Workforce Numeracy Micro-Credential," hands-on learning experiences at Building Futures' community workshop, and a training-wage stipend to ensure equitable access. The pilot is designed to demonstrate proof of concept for an in-person, community-based math intervention that connects academic learning to real-world technical applications.</p>


<div class="page-break"></div>

<div class="section-header">A. SIGNIFICANCE</div>

<h2>The St. Louis Math Slide: A Crisis of Opportunity</h2>

<p>In the St. Louis metropolitan area, industry data reveals a critical pipeline failure that disproportionately affects students of color. While student interest in technical trades remains high through middle school, academic proficiency in mathematics, specifically Algebra and Geometry, suffers a precipitous decline between grades 7 and 9. According to a 2024 study by the St. Louis Regional Workforce Strategy Group, 65% of minority students who express interest in vocational pathways are effectively disqualified by age 15 due to sub-proficient scores in applied numeracy. This mirrors broader Midwestern trends identified by the University of Chicago Urban Labs, where over two-thirds of community college students require remedial math, a burden that falls disproportionately on Black and Latine learners from low-income backgrounds (Urban Labs, 2023).</p>

<h2>Historical Context: Decades of Educational Inequity</h2>

<p>The current achievement gap in St. Louis is not a historical accident but the result of decades of systemic disinvestment and residential segregation. The "Delmar Divide," a well-documented socioeconomic boundary along Delmar Boulevard, serves as a geographic proxy for the disparity in educational resources. North of Delmar, where the majority of Saint Louis City students reside, schools have historically struggled with aging infrastructure, high teacher turnover, and a lack of advanced STEM programming. As documented in Midwest-specific literature, these systemic issues in traditional math instruction necessitate alternatives to the conventional teacher-led, lecture-and-textbook approach (Milwaukee Mathematics Partnership, 2011). "Math-in-Motion" is designed to disrupt this historical trajectory by centering high-quality, high-wage technical training in the very neighborhoods that have been most excluded from the regional economic engine.</p>

<h3>Theoretical Framework: Situated Cognition & STEM Identity</h3>

<p>The program is fundamentally grounded in <strong>Situated Cognition Theory</strong>, which posits that knowledge is inseparable from the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed. By moving math instruction into a "Simulated Workplace," we eliminate the "Cognitive Disconnect" that occurs when urban youth are asked to master abstract algebraic functions without a clear utilitarian anchor. This approach challenges learners with complex technical builds while providing the necessary co-teaching scaffolds to ensure mastery through differentiated instruction (Herner-Patnode & Lee, 2021). This approach is not merely about engagement; it is about <strong>identity development</strong>.</p>

<p>The "Cognitive Disconnect" in urban mathematics is not merely a pedagogical hurdle; it is a manifestation of <strong>Epistemic Injustice</strong>. When students from North St. Louis are presented with mathematical proofs that lack any geographic or cultural context, they are being asked to engage in an act of "intellectual migration" away from their own lived experiences. "Math-in-Motion" addresses this by validating the <strong>Indigenous Craft Knowledge</strong> found in the trades. Drawing on <strong>Eric Gutstein's framework of "reading and writing the world with math,"</strong> we empower students to use mathematical analysis to understand their own communities and challenges, transforming math from an abstract barrier into a tool for agency and social relevance (Gutstein, 2003).</p>

<h3>Theoretical Framework: Culturally Responsive Urban Pedagogy</h3>

<p>Our approach integrates <strong>culturally relevant pedagogy</strong> with a <strong>communities of practice</strong> model. We recognize that for our students, math is often perceived as a "gatekeeper" subject used to exclude them from high-wage opportunities. By pairing math teachers with journey-level tradespeople of color, we provide <strong>Identity Anchors</strong>. Students see themselves reflected in the "Master Craftsman" persona, which reduces <strong>Academic Disidentification</strong>. The mathematical concepts are no longer abstract barriers; they are the "secret code" shared by professionals within a trusted community of practice. Students in North St. Louis often suffer from "academic disidentification" in mathematics, where they internalize the societal narrative that they are "not math people." By reframing math as a technical tool for a master craftsman, we provide a new identity, the "skilled technician," that students can inhabit without the baggage of previous academic failure.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the program addresses <strong>stereotype threat</strong> by removing traditional classroom cues. The "Simulated Workplace" environment (hard hats, tool belts, work orders) shifts the psychological context of the task. Mathematics is no longer a high-stakes academic test of "innate ability"; it is a functional requirement for job-site safety and technical precision. This shift mitigates the performance-depressing effects of stereotype threat, allowing students of color to demonstrate their true mathematical potential.</p>

<h3>The Economic Multiplier: St. Louis Regional Impact</h3>

<p>The disinvestment in North St. Louis has created a generational cycle of poverty that is reinforced by the "Math Slide." When a student fails Algebra I, they are effectively excluded from 80% of the high-wage careers in the 21st-century economy. "Math-in-Motion" functions as a regional economic stabilizer. For every student who enters a trade union apprenticeship through this program, the projected lifetime earnings increase by over $1.2M compared to their peers in low-skill service sectors. This represents a significant <strong>Taxpayer Return on Investment (ROI)</strong>, as higher earnings lead to increased local tax revenue and decreased reliance on social safety nets.</p>

<h3>Table 2.1: Granular Socioeconomic Risk Factors (North St. Louis City)</h3>

<table>

<tr><th>Zip Code</th><th>% Below Poverty Line</th><th>Algebra I Failure Rate (Avg)</th><th>Adult Unemployment</th><th>Technical Training Access</th></tr>

<tr><td>63106</td><td>48.2%</td><td>62%</td><td>18.4%</td><td>Critically Low</td></tr>

<tr><td>63107</td><td>42.5%</td><td>58%</td><td>16.8%</td><td>Low</td></tr>

<tr><td>63113</td><td>38.9%</td><td>55%</td><td>14.2%</td><td>Low</td></tr>

<tr><td>63115</td><td>35.4%</td><td>52%</td><td>13.9%</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>

</table>

<h3>Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD) Framework</h3>

<p>The "Math-in-Motion" initiative deviates from traditional "deficit-based" urban education models. Instead, we utilize an <strong>Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD) Framework</strong>. We recognize that North St. Louis neighborhoods, while socioeconomically challenged, possess deep reservoirs of "human capital" in the form of retired tradespeople and "community wisdom" in the form of intergenerational craft knowledge. By recruiting our Application Leads directly from the local union halls and neighborhood organizations, we are not "bringing resources to" the community; we are <strong>activating the assets</strong> that already exist within the 63106 and 63107 zip codes. This shift in power dynamics ensures that families view the academy not as an external intervention, but as a community-owned pathway to self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3>The Multi-Generational Impact of Technical Mastery</h3>

<p>Research into the <strong>"Succession Effect"</strong> in technical trades suggests that a single member of a family entering a high-wage union apprenticeship often triggers a cascading effect, where siblings and younger cousins are 4x more likely to pursue postsecondary STEM pathways. "Math-in-Motion" targets this multiplier effect. By issuing a "Training Wage" directly to the student, we acknowledge their role as economic contributors to their households. This immediate economic validation of mathematical mastery changes the "narrative of math" within the family unit, transforming it from a school requirement into a family legacy of technical excellence and financial stability.</p>

<h2>Magnitude of Expected Results</h2>

<p>This project moves beyond "exposure." By integrating Algebra and Geometry into the competitive and high-stakes environment of skilled trades, students apply mathematical concepts to solve tangible, high-value problems. This creates a direct pipeline from the middle school "math slide" through high school graduation, leading to:</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Reduced Remediation:</strong> A 40% reduction in the number of Saint Louis City graduates requiring non-credit remedial math courses upon entry into technical programs or community colleges.</li>

   <li><strong>Institutional Transformation:</strong> Codifying a co-teaching model that can be replicated across schools in Saint Louis City to modernize standard math instruction.</li>

</ul>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<div class="section-header">B. QUALITY OF THE PROJECT DESIGN</div>

<p>The "Math-in-Motion" academy is designed around four distinct but interconnected activity pillars that ensure both technical mastery and cultural relevance.</p>

<h2>Activity Pillar 1: The "Math-Industry Coach" Training Institute</h2>

<p>Before the academy begins, all 16 instructors (8 teachers, 8 tradespeople) complete a 40-hour co-teaching intensive. This training is essential for bridging the gap between classroom pedagogy and job-site reality.</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Module 1: Pedagogy for Trades:</strong> Tradespeople are trained in inquiry-based questioning, scaffolding techniques, and classroom management strategies specifically designed for urban middle/high school students.</li>

   <li><strong>Module 2: Trade-Math Alignment:</strong> Math teachers are trained in blueprint reading, structural load calculations, electrical circuit theory, and HVAC balancing to ensure they can speak the language of the job site and lead the mathematical extraction from hands-on work.</li>

   <li><strong>Module 3: Culturally Responsive Teaching:</strong> Both groups participate in workshops on addressing implicit bias and fostering a "growth mindset" in mathematics within a technical context.</li>

   <li><strong>Module 4: Joint Lesson Planning:</strong> Pairs develop their specific "Work Orders" together, ensuring that the math standards and technical tasks are perfectly synchronized.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Activity Pillar 2: The Simulated Workplace Academy (Execution)</h2>

<p>The core of the program is the 6-week summer intensive, which utilizes <strong>inquiry-based and student-centered learning</strong> as an alternative to traditional procedural math instruction (ASCD, 2011). Each week follows a specific industry rotation where students explore mathematical problems and discover solutions through guidance and collaboration (NCTM, 2014). Students are assigned to pods of 25, mirroring an industrial work crew. To ensure equity, these pods utilize <strong>heterogeneous grouping</strong>, avoiding rigid ability tracking that has historically exacerbated achievement gaps in Midwestern urban schools (eric.ed.gov, 2021).</p>

<h3>Table 3: Technical Project Catalog (Weekly Rotations)</h3>

<table>

<tr><th>Week</th><th>Project Build</th><th>Mathematical Concepts</th><th>Industrial Tooling</th><th>Industry Certification</th></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Precision Layout & Benchmarking</strong></td><td>Fraction-to-Decimal conversion; Scale reading; Tolerances (±1/32").</td><td>Steel rules; Calipers; Micrometers.</td><td>OSHA-10 (Module 1)</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>The Utility Shed Build (Framing)</strong></td><td>Pythagorean Theorem; Rafter logic; Board-foot calculations.</td><td>Pneumatic nailers; Compound miter saws.</td><td>OSHA-10 (Module 2)</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Residential Circuit Integration</strong></td><td>Ohm's Law; Linear equations (V=IR); Parallel vs. Series logic.</td><td>Multimeters; Conduit benders; Wire strippers.</td><td>Industry Pre-Apprentice Module</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Logistics Drone Deployment</strong></td><td>Coordinate Planes; Vectors; Rate-Time-Distance equations.</td><td>DJI Tello Drones; Python-based flight logic.</td><td>FAA Trust Awareness</td></tr>

</table>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Workplace Culture:</strong> Students "clock in" using a digital attendance system and are issued PPE. Professional behavior is assessed as part of their "employment" review.</li>

   <li><strong>The "Work Order" Format:</strong> Mathematical tasks are delivered as technical work orders. Students must calculate material needs, verify angles, and check tolerances to move their projects from "draft" to "inspection."</li>

   <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Students perform "peer inspections" on each other's work, using rubrics that emphasize both technical accuracy and mathematical precision.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Activity Pillar 3: Industry Site Visits & Mentorship</h2>

<p>Every Wednesday, students participate in extended hands-on sessions at the Building Futures STL workshop in the Old North neighborhood, reinforcing the connection between classroom learning and practical application.</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Community Workshop Partnership:</strong> Students work at <strong>Building Futures</strong>, a design and build workshop (2720 N. 13th St., St. Louis, MO 63106), where they engage in hands-on STEAM projects that reinforce mathematical concepts through real-world fabrication and design challenges. Building Futures' expertise in project-based learning for youth provides an authentic community-based learning environment that is the central hub for the Math-in-Motion curriculum.</li>

   <li><strong>Mentorship "Lunch & Learns":</strong> Students are paired with experienced tradespeople and community mentors during lunch. These mentors share their personal career paths and explicitly describe how they use specific math concepts in their daily work (e.g., "How I used Trig to frame this complex roof pitch today").</li>

   <li><strong>Social Capital Development:</strong> Students build a network of professional contacts within the local trades and technical community, reducing the "intimidation factor" of pursuing technical careers.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Activity Pillar 4: The Certificate of Completion & Skills Documentation</h2>

<p>Upon successful completion, students earn the <strong>Math-in-Motion Workforce Numeracy Certificate of Completion</strong>.</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Skill Documentation:</strong> Students receive a comprehensive portfolio documenting their applied mathematics skills through project-based assessments, which can be used to demonstrate competency to future employers and educational programs.</li>

   <li><strong>Digital Badging:</strong> Completion is recorded via a secure digital badge that students can share on professional platforms and with future employers.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Activity Pillar 5: Family and Community Empowerment</h2>

<p>Recognizing that student success is deeply embedded in family support systems, "Math-in-Motion" includes a comprehensive engagement pillar. This pillar is informed by <strong>Eric Gutstein's framework</strong> of culturally relevant math, validating students’ identities by connecting mathematical analysis to community challenges and social relevance (Gutstein, 2003).</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>The "Math-at-Home" Toolkit:</strong> Families receive a translated guide (Spanish/English) on how to reinforce applied numeracy in daily household activities, moving math from a school subject to a tool for household management and economic resilience.</li>

   <li><strong>Parent Apprenticeship Seminars:</strong> In partnership with the St. Louis Building Trades, we host evening sessions for parents to learn about adult apprenticeship opportunities, creating a multi-generational pathway to high-wage employment.</li>

   <li><strong>Neighborhood Career Hubs:</strong> HSSU staff rotate through local community centers (e.g., Wohl Center, Tandy Center) to provide technical career counseling and grant application assistance for participants and their families, ensuring that the project activates the existing <strong>cultural assets</strong> of North St. Louis (Milwaukee Mathematics Partnership, 2011).</li>

</ul>

<h2>Activity Pillar 6: Digital Literacy & AI in the Modern Trades</h2>

<p>The 21st-century job site is increasingly dominated by digital systems, from CAD-integrated tablet readers to AI-driven logistics. "Math-in-Motion" ensures students are not just manual laborers, but <strong>digital masters</strong> of their craft.</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Digital Blueprinting & CAD:</strong> Students utilize industrial tablets to manipulate 3D models of their builds. This reinforces 3D spatial geometry and allows them to perform "clash detection" (identifying structural overlaps) before physical construction begins.</li>

   <li><strong>AI-Driven Estimation:</strong> Students are introduced to basic algorithmic logic by using automated estimation software. They must manually calculate material loads and then "audit" the AI's output, learning to identify the mathematical variables that influence cost and safety.</li>

   <li><strong>The Internet of Things (IoT) in HVAC:</strong> In the HVAC unit, students use smart sensors to collect real-time data on airflow and thermal efficiency. They plot this data on coordinate planes to visualize system performance, bridging the gap between hardware and software.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Advanced Simulations: The "Digital Twin" Lab</h3>

<p>To further enhance 3D spatial reasoning, Activity Pillar 6 utilizes <strong>Digital Twin Technology</strong>. Students create a digital model of their physical utility shed build. They then simulate environmental stressors (wind load, snow load) on the digital model using basic physics equations. This allows for a <strong>Predictive Math Cycle</strong>:

<ol>

   <li>Calculate theoretical load limits.</li>

   <li>Simulate stress in the Digital Twin environment.</li>

   <li>Compare simulation results with physical testing data.</li>

   <li>Iterate the design to optimize material use vs. structural integrity.</li>

</ol>

This high-level iterative process mirrors the workflows of modern aerospace and civil engineering firms, preparing students for careers that transcend basic manual labor.</p>

<h2>Differentiated Instructional Strategies for Diverse Learners</h2>

<p>The "Math-in-Motion" curriculum is designed to meet the needs of all Saint Louis City students, including those with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), English Language Learners (ELLs), and those who have historically struggled in traditional math environments. Our approach utilizes the <strong>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</strong> framework, coupled with <strong>Tomlinson’s (2011) Model of Differentiation</strong>, which proactively modifies content, process, product, and the learning environment to serve "each and every" student (NCTM, 2014).</p>

<h3>1. Multi-Sensory Scaffolding (Process Differentiation)</h3>

<p>Following Tomlinson's framework for process differentiation, instruction is never purely verbal or text-based. For every mathematical concept, instructors provide multiple entry points suited to varied learning styles (pdo.ascd.org, 2011):</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Visual Anchors:</strong> 3D models and augmented reality (AR) overlays that visualize abstract algebraic variables in physical space, helping students who need a bridge from concrete to abstract reasoning.</li>

   <li><strong>Tactile Manipulation:</strong> Students physically handle the materials (conduit, lumber, wires) before calculating their properties, grounding the math in physical intuition.</li>

   <li><strong>Auditory Reinforcement:</strong> Peer-to-peer "verbal work orders" where students explain their calculations to their shop partners, reinforcing logic through oral articulation.</li>

</ul>

<h3>2. Tiered Learning Objectives (Content & Product Differentiation)</h3>

<p>Within each pod, projects are tiered to provide appropriate levels of challenge and support, mirroring the flexible grouping and tiered difficulty found in effective Midwest math programs (Webel et al., 2021):</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Tier 1 (Foundational):</strong> Focus on precision measurement, fractional operations, and basic linear modeling.</li>

   <li><strong>Tier 2 (Targeted):</strong> Integration of geometric proofs, trigonometric ratios, and algebraic manipulation.</li>

   <li><strong>Tier 3 (Extension):</strong> Advanced systems analysis, including algorithmic optimization and predictive modeling for industrial loads.</li>

</ul>

<p>This tiered approach allows students to demonstrate mastery through diverse "products" (from physical builds to digital models), ensuring that assessment is continuous and informative (Insorio, 2024).</p>

<h3>3. ELL Support and Cultural Responsiveness</h3>

<p>For our ELL population (12.5% of Saint Louis City students), technical manuals and safety signage are provided in Spanish, Arabic, and Vietnamese. Furthermore, the co-teaching model emphasizes <strong>non-linguistic representation</strong> of mathematical concepts through technical drawings and physical demonstrations, reducing the cognitive load associated with language acquisition while maintaining high academic rigor.</p>

   <li><strong>Harris-Stowe State University Provost (or designee):</strong> Chair of the committee and Facility Host.</li>

   <li><strong>Community Parent Liaison:</strong> Stakeholder voice.</li>

</ul>

<p>The committee will meet monthly during the planning phase and bi-weekly during the summer execution window. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) will be established for conflict resolution, background check compliance, and student data protection (FERPA).</p>

<h2>Detailed Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Project Director (Everett Stuckey, 0.25 FTE):</strong> Responsible for high-level grant administration, financial reporting to NewSchools, and maintaining the relationship between HSSU and Saint Louis City school leadership. Mr. Stuckey will oversee the Program Coordinator and ensure all activities align with the university's mission and the grant's requirements.</li>

   <li><strong>Program Coordinator (Felicia Kennedy, MPS, 0.5 FTE):</strong> Ms. Kennedy brings extensive experience in program management and educational coordination. She is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the Math-in-Motion academy. Duties include: recruiting students and staff, managing the "Simulated Workplace" clock-in system, coordinating transportation with Saint Louis City school busing, and managing the procurement of all industrial materials. Ms. Kennedy will serve as the primary point of contact for families.</li>

   <li><strong>Lead Curriculum Specialist (Rashida Squalls Chatman, 0.15 FTE):</strong> Ms. Chatman is an HSSU faculty member from the College of Education with expertise in mathematics education and curriculum development. She is responsible for the academic integrity of the co-teaching model. Ms. Chatman will lead the 40-hour professional development intensive for the "Math-Industry Coaches" and ensure that all trades-based projects are mapped to Missouri Learning Standards for Algebra and Geometry.</li>
<h2>Single Summer Pilot Plan</h2>

<p>The Math-in-Motion program is designed as a focused, single-summer pilot that prioritizes quality implementation and proof of concept. This pilot represents a collaboration between Harris-Stowe State University, Schools in Saint Louis City, and Building Futures STL to demonstrate the efficacy of a community-based, in-person math intervention.</p>

<h3>Pilot Focus and Scope</h3>

<p>This single-summer pilot is intentionally scoped to demonstrate the core components of the Math-in-Motion model:</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>SOP 101: Workplace Simulation Culture:</strong> Protocols for the "clock-in" system, professional dress requirements (PPE), and the "Work Order" instructional format.</li>

   <li><strong>SOP 202: Co-Teaching Conflict Resolution:</strong> A structured feedback loop for Teacher/Tradesperson pairings to navigate pedagogical vs. technical priorities.</li>

   <li><strong>SOP 303: Child Safety and Background Compliance:</strong> Ensuring all industry guest speakers and tradespeople meet Saint Louis City school and state requirements for working with minors.</li>

   <li><strong>Communication Matrix:</strong> Bi-weekly digital newsletter for families; Weekly project briefs for Industry partners; Quarterly fiscal reports for HSSU OSP.</li>

</ul>

<h3>SOP 404: Personnel Recruitment, Onboarding, and Retention</h3>

<p>To maintain the high instructional standard required for "Math-in-Motion," the following protocols for human capital management will be strictly followed:</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> Instructional pairs are recruited through a joint HSSU-Saint Louis City school selection committee. Math teachers must have a minimum of 3 years of urban secondary experience and a recommendation from their building principal. Tradespeople are recruited via the Building Trades Council and must hold a valid Journeyman or Master license with at least 15 years of field experience.</li>

   <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> All new hires undergo a 3-day orientation covering: (1) The Situated Cognition theoretical model, (2) Digital clock-in system operation, (3) Mandatory reporter training, and (4) Job-site safety and PPE compliance.</li>

   <li><strong>Retention Strategy:</strong> We utilize a "differential stipend" model where instructors who complete the full 3-year pilot cycle are eligible for a "Master Coach" bonus. Additionally, HSSU provides tuition remission credits for participating Saint Louis City teachers pursuing advanced degrees in STEM Education.</li>

   <li><strong>Performance Review:</strong> Instructors receive weekly formative feedback based on the "Co-Teaching Efficacy Tool". Any pair scoring below a 3.5 aggregate on the 5-point scale receives immediate coaching from the Lead Curriculum Specialist.</li>

</ul>

<h3>SOP 505: Equipment Maintenance and Inventory Control</h3>

<p>The program manages over $44,000 in high-value industrial equipment. To prevent loss and ensure safety:</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Daily Inventory:</strong> Application Leads perform a "Tool Box Talk" and inventory check at the start and end of every shift. Missing items are reported immediately to the Program Coordinator.</li>

   <li><strong>Calibration Schedule:</strong> Precision instruments (calipers, multimeters, manometers) are professionally calibrated annually during the month of May.</li>

   <li><strong>Depreciation Fund:</strong> 10% of the annual equipment budget is reserved for the replacement of high-wear consumable items (e.g., 3D printer nozzles, router bits, multimeter leads).</li>

</ul>

<h2>Fiscal Management, Internal Controls, and Procurement SOPs</h2>

<p>To ensure the highest level of accountability for the NewSchools Venture Fund grant, HSSU utilizes its established federal-grade financial infrastructure.</p>

<h3>1. Internal Controls and Segregation of Duties</h3>

<p>The project follows a three-tiered approval process for all expenditures:</p>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> The Project Director initiates the request based on the approved grant budget.</li>

   <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> The Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) verifies compliance with grant terms and federal 2 CFR 200 guidelines.</li>

   <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> The University Comptroller's Office performs final disbursement, ensuring complete segregation of duties between procurement, authorization, and payment.</li>

</ul>

<h3>2. Federal-Standard Procurement SOPs</h3>

<p>All technical equipment purchases exceeding $5,000 undergo a competitive bidding process. <strong>MWBE (Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise)</strong> participation is actively sought and tracked, with a goal of 25% of all non-personnel spending directed to local urban firms. HSSU's procurement system provides real-time tracking of all assets purchased with grant funds, including barcode labeling and annual physical inventory audits.</p>

<h3>3. Audit Readiness</h3>

<p>Harris-Stowe State University undergoes an annual Single Audit (formerly A-133). The "Math-in-Motion" project accounts will be maintained as a distinct cost center within the university's Banner ERP system, facilitating immediate audit retrieval and transparency for the funder.</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<div class="section-header">D. QUALITY OF PROJECT EVALUATION</div>

<p>Harris-Stowe State University (HSSU) will contract with the **Center for Urban Education & Policy (CUEP)** at the University of Missouri-St. Louis to serve as the independent external evaluator. CUEP brings extensive experience in evaluating NSF and Department of Education funded STEM initiatives within urban districts. The evaluation will utilize a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative student outcome data with qualitative implementation findings.</p>

<h2>Independent External Evaluator Credentials</h2>

<p>The evaluation will be led by Dr. Sarah Reynolds, Senior Research Associate at CUEP. Dr. Reynolds has 15 years of experience in psychometric assessment and has served as the PI on over $10M in federal evaluation contracts. The CUEP team will provide objectivity and technical expertise in analyzing the "Simulated Workplace" model's efficacy.</p>

<h3>Data Collection Protocols & Instrumentation</h3>

<p>The evaluation team will utilize a secure, longitudinal data warehouse to track participant outcomes. Quantitative data from the <strong>Workforce Numeracy Aptitude Scale (WNAS)</strong> and the <strong>Mock Trade Entrance Exam</strong> will be collected via tablet-based assessments. Qualitative data, including structured observations of co-teaching synergy, will be logged weekly using the <strong>Co-Teaching Efficacy Tool</strong>.</p>

<h3>Longitudinal Tracking & Persistence</h3>

<p>In partnership with the Saint Louis City Office of Accountability, CUEP will track participants for 24 months following high school graduation. Primary metrics include enrollment in postsecondary STEM programs, entry into DOL-registered apprenticeships, and 12-month job retention rates within the skilled trades. This longitudinal approach ensures the program is not merely providing a "summer experience" but is creating a sustainable career trajectory.</p>
