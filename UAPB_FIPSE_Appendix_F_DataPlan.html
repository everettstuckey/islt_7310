<h2>3. INFORMED CONSENT AND ASSENT PROCEDURES</h2>

<h3>3.1 IRB Approval</h3>
<p>Prior to any data collection, the project will submit a comprehensive IRB application to the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Institutional Review Board. The application will describe all data collection instruments, procedures, risks, benefits, and safeguards. Data collection will not begin until IRB approval is obtained.</p>

<h3>3.2 Parent/Guardian Consent (for students under 18)</h3>
<p>At the beginning of each robotics season, parents/guardians of all participating students will receive a detailed consent form explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose of the research/evaluation</li>
<li>Types of data to be collected (surveys, academic records, observations)</li>
<li>How data will be used (program evaluation, annual reports to funder, research publications)</li>
<li>Risks and benefits of participation</li>
<li>Procedures to protect confidentiality</li>
<li>Right to withdraw at any time without penalty</li>
<li>Contact information for project staff and UAPB IRB</li>
</ul>

<p>Consent forms will be available in English and Spanish. Parents may consent for their child to participate in the robotics program while declining participation in research/evaluation activities; student participation in robotics is not contingent on research consent.</p>

<h3>3.3 Student Assent (for students under 18)</h3>
<p>In addition to parent consent, students will provide written assent using age-appropriate language. The assent form will explain the study in simple terms and emphasize that participation is voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.</p>

<h3>3.4 Adult Consent (for alumni mentors and teachers)</h3>
<p>Adult participants (mentors and teachers) will provide informed consent before participating in surveys, focus groups, or interviews. Consent forms will explain data use, confidentiality measures, and the right to withdraw.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>4. DATA SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>

<h3>4.1 De-Identification</h3>
<p>All student data will be de-identified before analysis and reporting. Each student will be assigned a unique research ID number. A master key linking names to ID numbers will be stored separately from the data in a password-protected file accessible only to the Program Coordinator and External Evaluator.</p>

<h3>4.2 Data Storage</h3>

<p><strong>Electronic Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All electronic data will be stored on UAPB's secure servers with encrypted backup.</li>
<li>Survey data collected via Qualtrics will be stored on UAPB's institutional Qualtrics account with SSL encryption and two-factor authentication enabled.</li>
<li>Access to data files will be restricted to authorized project personnel through role-based permissions.</li>
<li>All computers and devices used to access data will be password-protected and encrypted.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Paper Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paper consent forms and any paper surveys will be stored in locked filing cabinets in the Program Coordinator's office.</li>
<li>Paper records will be scanned and uploaded to secure servers, then retained in locked storage for the duration of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3 Data Transmission</h3>
<p>When data must be transmitted between project staff and the External Evaluator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files will be encrypted using AES-256 encryption</li>
<li>Secure file transfer protocols (SFTP or encrypted email via Virtru) will be used</li>
<li>No PII will be transmitted via unencrypted email or cloud storage services</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.4 FERPA Compliance</h3>
<p>When requesting student academic records (GPA, course enrollment, standardized test scores) from partner school districts:</p>
<ul>
<li>UAPB will execute FERPA-compliant data sharing agreements with each district</li>
<li>Data will be requested using student research IDs, not names, where possible</li>
<li>Districts will transmit data via secure methods (encrypted files, secure FTP)</li>
<li>UAPB will maintain data as "education records" and apply FERPA protections</li>
<li>No student-level data will be publicly reported or shared with third parties without explicit consent</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.5 Data Retention and Disposal</h3>
<p>Data will be retained for three years following the submission of the final grant report to the Department of Education, consistent with federal record retention requirements. After this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic data files will be securely deleted (overwritten, not merely deleted)</li>
<li>Paper records will be shredded using a cross-cut shredder</li>
<li>The master key linking names to research IDs will be destroyed first, rendering remaining data permanently de-identified</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>5. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE</h2>

<h3>5.1 Survey Administration Protocols</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standardized Instructions:</strong> All surveys will include clear, standardized instructions to ensure consistent administration.</li>
<li><strong>Pilot Testing:</strong> Survey instruments will be pilot tested with small groups prior to full implementation to identify ambiguous items or technical issues.</li>
<li><strong>Response Validation:</strong> Qualtrics will be configured with response validation rules (e.g., required fields, range checks) to minimize missing or invalid data.</li>
<li><strong>Completion Monitoring:</strong> Program Coordinator will monitor survey completion rates and send reminders to non-respondents to maximize response rates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2 Data Entry and Verification</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paper surveys (if any) will be double-entered by two different staff members to identify transcription errors.</li>
<li>Discrepancies will be resolved by referring to the original paper form.</li>
<li>Data files will be checked for out-of-range values, duplicate records, and logical inconsistencies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3 Documentation</h3>
<p>The External Evaluator will maintain comprehensive documentation including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection protocols and field notes</li>
<li>Codebooks defining all variables, response options, and coding schemes</li>
<li>Data cleaning logs documenting all corrections and transformations</li>
<li>Analytic syntax/code used for statistical analyses (to ensure reproducibility)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>6. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING</h2>

<h3>6.1 Quantitative Analysis</h3>
<p>The External Evaluator will conduct quantitative analyses using SPSS or R statistical software. Key analyses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Frequencies, means, standard deviations for all outcome measures</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Post Comparisons:</strong> Paired t-tests or repeated measures ANOVA to assess change in AI Literacy, mentor self-efficacy, and student postsecondary intent</li>
<li><strong>Effect Sizes:</strong> Cohen's d to quantify magnitude of change</li>
<li><strong>Subgroup Analyses:</strong> Disaggregation by gender, grade level, prior CS experience to identify differential impacts</li>
<li><strong>Outcome Tracking:</strong> Calculation of percentages meeting target benchmarks (e.g., % of students achieving 0.5 SD growth; % of seniors applying to STEM programs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Qualitative Analysis</h3>
<p>Focus group transcripts and open-ended survey responses will be analyzed using thematic coding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transcripts will be coded independently by two researchers using NVivo software</li>
<li>Initial codes will be developed deductively (based on research questions) and inductively (emerging from data)</li>
<li>Inter-rater reliability will be assessed; disagreements will be resolved through discussion</li>
<li>Themes will be organized into meaningful categories and illustrated with representative quotes</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.3 Reporting and Dissemination</h3>
<p><strong>Annual Reports to Funder:</strong> UAPB will submit annual performance reports to the Department of Education including aggregate data on outputs (students served, mentors trained) and outcomes (test scores, enrollment rates). No individual-level data will be reported.</p>

<p><strong>Public Dissemination:</strong> Project findings may be presented at conferences or published in peer-reviewed journals. All public dissemination will use only de-identified, aggregate data. Specific safeguards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell sizes < 5 will be suppressed to prevent re-identification</li>
<li>No photographs or videos of minors will be used without explicit parental consent</li>
<li>All quotes will be anonymized (names, schools, identifying details removed)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Participant Access:</strong> At the conclusion of the project, participating students, mentors, and teachers will receive a summary report of findings in accessible language. Individual students/mentors will not receive their own data.</p>

<h2>10. ETHICS COMMITMENTS</h2>

<p>Beyond regulatory compliance, the UAPB Robotics Futures project commits to the following ethical principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Respect for Persons:</strong> We will honor students' autonomy, obtain meaningful consent, and provide additional protections for minors.</li>
<li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> We will maximize benefits (high-quality mentorship, AI education) and minimize risks (no collection of sensitive data beyond what is necessary).</li>
<li><strong>Justice:</strong> We will ensure that the benefits of research (improved AI literacy, college access) are equitably distributed and do not disproportionately burden any group.</li>
<li><strong>Fidelity and Responsibility:</strong> We will be transparent with participants about data use, maintain their trust, and act with integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> We will recognize that our participants are primarily Black students and alumni. Data collection and reporting will avoid deficit framing and instead highlight strengths, assets, and systemic barriers.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Data Collection and Management Plan will be reviewed annually and updated as needed to reflect changes in regulations, technology, or project activities.</p>
