    "summary": "When I entered the ISLT program, I brought a counselor\u2019s mindset and a financier\u2019s analytical discipline, but my technology practice was largely pragmatic. In daily school work, I made tools \u201cwork well enough\u201d to meet immediate student needs , sharing resources, simplifying instructions, and troubleshooting access barriers. What I lacked was a systematic framework for designing technology-enhanced learning experiences end to end: aligning needs to outcomes, selecting tools intentionally, measuring impact, and then iterating for equity and clarity. I chose the ISLT program, Technology in Schools emphasis, to build that structure around my practice. I wanted to develop reusable patterns for accessible web design, rapid prototyping, and responsible use of learning data that could scale beyond individual interventions. Entering the program, I was comfortable with quantitative reasoning and stakeholder communication from my finance background and counseling experience, but I needed deeper knowledge in interaction design, evaluation, and standards-based technology integration. The ISLT coursework challenged me to move from ad hoc solutions to an evidence-driven, ethically grounded design approach, one that serves students and families across devices, bandwidth, and contexts while protecting their privacy and honoring their time.",
