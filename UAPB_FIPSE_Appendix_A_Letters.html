<p><strong>Re: Letter of Commitment for UAPB Robotics Futures FIPSE Grant Application</strong></p>

<p>Dear Chancellor [Name],</p>

<p>On behalf of Saint Louis Public Schools (SLPS), I am pleased to provide this letter of commitment in support of the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff's application for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) Special Projects grant, "UAPB Robotics Futures: The UAPB Alumni Mentorship Network for AI & Robotics Pathways."</p>

<p>Saint Louis Public Schools serves approximately 20,000 students across 65 schools, with 82% of our students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch and 77% identifying as Black or African American. Our district is deeply committed to expanding access to high-quality STEM education and creating pathways to postsecondary success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.</p>

<p>Currently, SLPS supports six FIRST Robotics teams across our high schools: Vashon High School, Sumner High School, Gateway STEM High School, McKinley Classical Leadership Academy, Roosevelt High School, and Collegiate School of Medicine and Bioscience. While these teams demonstrate strong student engagement and competitive performance, we recognize that our students would benefit significantly from enhanced technical mentorship in artificial intelligence and advanced computing—areas where our teacher capacity is limited.</p>

<p>SLPS commits to the following for the duration of the UAPB Robotics Futures project (October 2026–September 2030):</p>

<p><strong>1. School Access and Coordination:</strong> SLPS will facilitate UAPB mentor access to our six participating robotics teams, including coordination with building principals, robotics coaches, and athletic directors to schedule on-site visits during Build Season and after-school programming.</p>

<p><strong>2. Teacher Participation in Professional Development:</strong> SLPS will release robotics coaches and STEM teachers to participate in the summer professional development institutes at UAPB without loss of pay or benefits. We will support their travel to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, for these trainings.</p>

<p><strong>3. Student Recruitment for Bridge Institute:</strong> SLPS College and Career Readiness staff will identify and recruit eligible students for the summer UAPB AI & Robotics Bridge Institute, assist with application processes, and coordinate transportation logistics for participating students.</p>

<p><strong>4. Data Collection and Evaluation:</strong> SLPS will cooperate fully with the project's external evaluator, including facilitating student surveys, providing de-identified academic and demographic data consistent with FERPA requirements, and participating in program improvement discussions.</p>

<p><strong>5. Sustainability Planning:</strong> SLPS will work with UAPB to develop a sustainability plan that enables continued mentor support and AI curriculum integration beyond the federal funding period, including exploring partnerships with local employers and foundations.</p>

<p>SLPS values our existing partnership with the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, including the Chancellor Scholarship initiative that reserves a full scholarship for an SLPS graduating senior. The UAPB Robotics Futures project represents a natural extension of this partnership, bringing UAPB's expertise and alumni network directly into our classrooms to inspire and prepare the next generation of Black engineers and computer scientists.</p>

<p>We are confident that this project will significantly strengthen the AI and computer science preparation of SLPS students, increase their postsecondary enrollment in STEM fields, and contribute to greater diversity in the technology workforce. SLPS is fully committed to the success of this initiative.</p>

<p><strong>Re: Letter of Support for UAPB Robotics Futures FIPSE Grant Application</strong></p>

<p>Dear Chancellor [Name],</p>

<p>The Arkansas Department of Education (ADE) is pleased to provide this letter of support for the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff's application to the U.S. Department of Education for the FIPSE Special Projects grant, "UAPB Robotics Futures: The UAPB Alumni Mentorship Network for AI & Robotics Pathways."</p>

<p>Arkansas has made significant investments in expanding computer science education over the past decade. Act 187 of 2019 requires all Arkansas high schools to offer at least one computer science course, and we have trained over 2,000 teachers in CS pedagogy through the CS4AR initiative. However, we recognize that access to advanced computing topics—particularly artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics—remains limited, especially in rural and underserved communities.</p>

<p>The UAPB Robotics Futures project directly addresses this gap by leveraging the expertise of UAPB alumni to provide technical mentorship for FIRST Robotics teams in Arkansas school districts. This model is particularly promising because it brings real-world professionals into classrooms, exposes students to advanced technical content, and provides culturally responsive mentorship from successful Black STEM professionals.</p>

<p>The Arkansas Department of Education commits to the following support for this project:</p>

<p><strong>1. District Recruitment and Coordination:</strong> ADE will assist UAPB in identifying and recruiting school districts in Arkansas with existing or emerging FIRST Robotics programs that would benefit from this mentorship model. We will facilitate introductions to district superintendents, curriculum coordinators, and STEM teachers.</p>

<p><strong>2. Alignment with State Standards:</strong> ADE will ensure that the project's AI curriculum and teacher professional development materials align with Arkansas Computer Science Standards and the Arkansas CS4AR framework. We will provide technical assistance to ensure curriculum coherence.</p>

<p><strong>3. Professional Development Credit:</strong> ADE will work with UAPB to ensure that teachers participating in the summer professional development institutes receive appropriate professional learning credit that counts toward Arkansas licensure renewal requirements.</p>

<p><strong>4. Dissemination and Scaling:</strong> ADE will support the dissemination of project findings and best practices through our statewide CS4AR network, annual Computer Science Summit, and digital resource platforms. Successful strategies from this project can inform future ADE initiatives to expand AI education statewide.</p>

<p><strong>5. Policy Advocacy:</strong> ADE will consider policy recommendations emerging from this project, including potential expansion of computer science standards to include AI literacy and strategies for recruiting industry professionals as classroom mentors.</p>

<p>We commend UAPB for this innovative approach to bridging K-12 and higher education in computer science and AI. This project exemplifies the kind of cross-sector collaboration necessary to ensure all Arkansas students—regardless of zip code or economic circumstance—have access to the computational skills that will define 21st century careers.</p>

<p><strong>Re: Letter of Support for UAPB Robotics Futures FIPSE Grant</strong></p>

<p>Dear Chancellor [Name],</p>

<p>FIRST<sup>®</sup> (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is pleased to provide this letter of support for the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff's application for the FIPSE Special Projects grant, "UAPB Robotics Futures: The UAPB Alumni Mentorship Network for AI & Robotics Pathways."</p>

<p>The FIRST Mid-America Region serves teams across Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Southern Illinois. Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build STEM skills, confidence, and life skills. We support approximately 150 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams and 300 FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams annually.</p>

<p>One of our persistent challenges is ensuring that teams in under-resourced schools and communities have access to the technical mentorship necessary to compete at the highest levels. Many schools can form teams and secure basic equipment, but without engineers and computer scientists to guide students through complex programming and system integration, these teams struggle to develop the advanced capabilities that make robotics truly transformative.</p>

<p>The UAPB Robotics Futures model directly addresses this challenge by systematically training and deploying HBCU alumni as technical mentors. The focus on artificial intelligence and computer vision is particularly timely, as these technologies are increasingly central to competitive robotics but remain inaccessible to many teams.</p>

<p>FIRST Mid-America commits to the following support:</p>

<p><strong>1. Team Identification and Coordination:</strong> We will assist UAPB in identifying Missouri and Arkansas teams that would benefit most from this mentorship model, prioritizing teams in Title I schools and schools serving majority-minority student populations.</p>

<p><strong>2. Registration and Event Support:</strong> We will work with UAPB to streamline registration processes for supported teams and ensure they are assigned to regional competitions that facilitate mentor attendance. We will waive event fees where possible for teams facing financial hardship.</p>

<p><strong>3. Mentor Training Resources:</strong> FIRST will provide UAPB access to our mentor training materials, volunteer management platforms, and youth protection protocols to ensure all mentors are properly vetted and trained consistent with FIRST standards.</p>

<p><strong>4. Recognition and Dissemination:</strong> We will feature the UAPB Robotics Futures program at regional kickoff events, championship competitions, and through FIRST communications channels. We will facilitate knowledge-sharing with other FIRST regions to enable replication of this model nationally.</p>

<p><strong>5. Data Sharing:</strong> With appropriate permissions, FIRST will provide UAPB's external evaluator with team performance data, student demographic data, and competition outcomes to support program evaluation.</p>

<p>FIRST believes that the UAPB Robotics Futures project represents a model of excellence in how universities, particularly HBCUs, can leverage their alumni networks to expand opportunity for K-12 students. We are excited to partner with UAPB on this initiative and look forward to seeing the impact on students, mentors, and communities.</p>
