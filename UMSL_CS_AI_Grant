Project summary. 
Gateway AI Pathways will create a coherent dual credit computer science and AI pipeline between the University of Missouri–St. Louis and Saint Louis Public Schools that simultaneously: 

Expands student access to rigorous computer science and AI coursework through transcripted dual credit courses aligned with UMSL degree requirements and Missouri standards. 

Builds the capacity of current and future educators to teach computer science and AI literacy, by embedding AI content into UMSL teacher preparation programs and providing sustained professional development and micro credentials for SLPS teachers. 

Connects secondary coursework to college and career outcomes through structured advising, exposure to AI related careers, and alignment with regional workforce needs in high skill, high wage sectors. 

Over four years, the partnership will design, pilot, and scale an articulated sequence of dual credit courses in introductory computer science, foundations of AI and data literacy, and applied AI in real world domains. These courses will be delivered in SLPS high schools through co taught models involving UMSL faculty and SLPS teachers who earn specialized preparation to serve as dual credit instructors. In parallel, UMSL will revise teacher education curricula to include an AI in Education requirement and will develop professional learning pathways and micro credentials in AI literacy and computer science pedagogy for inservice SLPS teachers. 

The project will initially serve at least 150 SLPS students and 25 teachers in Year 1 and will grow to a cumulative total of at least 600 students and 80 educators by the end of the project period. A mixed methods evaluation will examine impacts on student AI literacy, dual credit accumulation, postsecondary enrollment in computing and STEM fields, and teacher capacity to teach AI and computer science. Openly licensed curricular materials, implementation tools, and evaluation findings will support replication by other IHE–LEA partnerships.

2. Project Narrative 

A. Significance (Maximum 30 points) 

A.1. National and local need 

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the nature of work, civic life, and knowledge production. The Federal Register notice emphasizes that AI literacy is now essential for navigating and contributing to a society in which algorithmic systems play a growing role in decision making, communication, and innovation. At the same time, access to rigorous computer science and AI education remains uneven. Students in high poverty urban districts are less likely to have access to advanced computer science courses, experienced computer science teachers, or consistent opportunities for dual enrollment in computing related fields. These disparities directly constrain who can participate in and benefit from AI driven economic change. 

Saint Louis Public Schools serves a student population with high levels of economic disadvantage and a history of structural barriers to postsecondary success. Many students are first generation college aspirants who attend schools with limited advanced coursework and teacher capacity in computer science. Without intentional intervention, the very communities most affected by automation and AI driven restructuring of the labor market will remain underrepresented in AI design, governance, and leadership. 

UMSL is the metropolitan public research university that serves the city of St. Louis. It has long standing commitments to equity, community engagement, and preparation of educators and professionals for the region’s schools and industries. UMSL already offers undergraduate majors and minors in computer science, information systems, cybersecurity, and STEM education. However, the institution’s teacher preparation programs and dual credit structures have not yet been systematically reoriented around AI literacy and AI in education. This project leverages UMSL’s role in the region and SLPS’s position as the largest urban LEA in the metropolitan area to respond directly to the national need identified in Absolute Priority 2. 

A.2. Innovation and potential for improved outcomes (Criterion A.i) 

The proposed project is innovative in several respects: 

Concurrent focus on students and educators. Many efforts to expand computer science access focus either on student coursework or teacher preparation. This project addresses both simultaneously. It uses dual credit courses not only to provide students with early postsecondary credit but also to create authentic teaching laboratories for preservice teachers and professional learning environments for inservice teachers. 

Integration of AI literacy across teacher preparation and general education. AI related content will be treated as foundational rather than specialized. UMSL will embed AI literacy, ethics, and instructional uses of AI into teacher preparation requirements and into general education offerings that are accessible to students in multiple majors. 

Alignment of secondary coursework, IHE programs, and workforce needs. The dual credit sequence will be purposefully mapped to UMSL degree requirements and to regional AI and technology workforce demand. Students will see clear linkages between high school course choices, postsecondary programs, and in demand occupations. 

Use of AI tools as both subject and medium. AI is not only content in the curriculum but also a set of tools for instruction, differentiation, tutoring, and data use. The project will intentionally explore the use of AI enabled feedback systems, analytics dashboards, and tutoring environments while helping educators and students critically examine their benefits and risks. 

These innovations are expected to improve outcomes along several dimensions: 

Increased student enrollment and success in rigorous computer science and AI coursework. 

Higher rates of college matriculation and persistence in computing related majors among participating students. 

Strengthened teacher self efficacy and instructional quality in computer science and AI literacy. 

More coherent and equitable access to dual credit and early college pathways in SLPS. 

A.3. Importance and magnitude of expected results (Criterion A.ii) 

The expected outcomes are of substantial importance for both local and national priorities. Locally, the project aims to: 

Serve at least 600 unduplicated SLPS students in dual credit AI and computer science courses across four years. 

Establish a sustainable dual credit sequence that continues beyond the grant period. 

Prepare at least 80 SLPS teachers and a substantial number of UMSL preservice teachers to integrate AI literacy into their instruction and to deliver computer science courses. 

Nationally, the project has potential to contribute to models of AI education that: 

Demonstrate how IHEs can respond to Executive Order 14179 and Executive Order 14277 by aligning secondary, postsecondary, and workforce systems around AI literacy. 

Show how dual credit structures can be used to bring AI and computer science opportunities to students in high need urban districts. 

Provide evidence regarding the impacts of AI integrated dual enrollment on postsecondary outcomes. 

The magnitude of potential benefits extends beyond individual course completions. Successful implementation would alter the opportunity structure for an entire district’s students with respect to AI and computing fields and would reshape how a public university prepares future teachers and professionals for an AI intensive society. 

 

B. Quality of the Project Design (Maximum 45 points) 

B.1. Overall goals, objectives, and logic model 

Goal 1 – Expand equitable access to rigorous AI and computer science coursework for SLPS students through dual credit offerings aligned with UMSL programs. 

Objective 1.1: Design and approve at least three dual credit courses in computer science and AI that meet UMSL curricular standards and Missouri high school graduation requirements. 

Objective 1.2: Enroll at least 150 students in Year 1 and 600 cumulative students by Year 4, with representation from multiple SLPS high schools and student subgroups. 

Objective 1.3: Ensure that at least 70 percent of students earn a grade of C or higher in dual credit courses. 

Goal 2 – Build the capacity of future and current educators to teach AI literacy and computer science. 

Objective 2.1: Integrate an AI in Education module or course into UMSL teacher preparation programs within the first two project years. 

Objective 2.2: Provide multi tiered professional development and micro credentials in AI literacy and computer science pedagogy to at least 80 SLPS teachers over four years. 

Objective 2.3: Increase teacher self reported confidence in teaching AI and computer science concepts by at least 20 percentage points from baseline. 

Goal 3 – Strengthen advising, work based learning, and postsecondary transitions into AI and computing fields. 

Objective 3.1: Develop clear pathway maps connecting dual credit courses to UMSL majors and regional AI related careers. 

Objective 3.2: Engage at least 50 students per year in AI related work based learning, mentoring, or exposure experiences by Year 3. 

Objective 3.3: Increase by at least 10 percentage points the rate at which participating students enroll in postsecondary programs in computer science, information systems, data science, engineering, or related teacher education. 

The logic model links project inputs (funding, staff, existing curricula, and partnerships) to activities (course design, PD, advising, and evaluation), outputs (courses, micro credentials, pathway maps, work based learning experiences), and outcomes (AI literacy, course completion, postsecondary enrollment and persistence, teacher capacity). Continuous improvement processes will monitor implementation fidelity and outcomes, allowing refinement over time. 

B.2. Integration with and building on related efforts (Criterion B.1) 

The design intentionally integrates and builds on existing local and national efforts. 

Existing dual credit infrastructure. UMSL and SLPS already collaborate on dual credit in other disciplines. The project will build on established registration systems, financial models, and credit transfer policies, while tailoring them to the unique demands of AI and computer science. 

State and district initiatives in college and career readiness. SLPS participates in statewide efforts to increase dual enrollment, career pathway clarity, and work based learning opportunities. The project will align with these initiatives by positioning AI and computer science as central components of STEM and information technology pathways. 

UMSL academic programs. The dual credit sequence will map directly onto UMSL degree requirements in computer science and related fields, as well as teacher preparation programs. This ensures that students’ earned credits accelerate progress toward degrees rather than simply accumulating as electives. 

Federal and state standards. The curriculum will align with the federal definition of computer science provided in the notice and with state standards for computer science, digital literacy, and technology education. This alignment increases transferability and policy relevance. 

The project will also leverage existing funding streams and resources where appropriate, such as district professional development funds, state support for dual credit, and existing advising and counseling infrastructure. FIPSE funding will be used to build new capacity and create an integrated AI and computer science pathway that extends beyond what current resources support. 

B.3. Core components of the design and implementation plan (Criterion B.2 and B.3) 

Component 1 – Dual credit AI and computer science course sequence

Developing standards aligned syllabi, learning objectives, assessments, and resources that meet UMSL quality expectations and are adaptable for delivery in multiple SLPS schools. 

Creating an instructor qualification and training process that enables SLPS teachers who meet UMSL criteria to become dual credit instructors, supported through mentoring by UMSL faculty. 

Piloting the sequence in two to three SLPS high schools in Year 1, then expanding to additional schools in subsequent years, with attention to geographic and demographic diversity. 

Quality controls will include peer review of syllabi and assessments, observation protocols for classroom implementation, and student feedback mechanisms. Continuous improvement will be supported through annual curriculum review meetings that incorporate evaluation findings. 

Component 2 – AI literacy integration in UMSL teacher preparation 

Activities include: 

Reviewing all UMSL teacher preparation programs to identify where AI literacy, computer science principles, and responsible AI use can be embedded. 

Designing an AI in Education requirement that addresses: 

AI concepts at a level appropriate for non computer science majors. 

Ethical considerations, including bias, fairness, transparency, and privacy. 

Instructional uses of AI tools for differentiation, feedback, and assessment. 

Strategies for teaching students to critically evaluate AI outputs and AI generated misinformation. 

Integrating AI related assignments and experiences into methods courses and field experiences, particularly for preservice teachers placed in SLPS schools participating in the dual credit program. 

Creating opportunities for preservice teachers to co teach or assist in dual credit AI and computer science courses under supervision, thus aligning teacher preparation with the project’s K–12 instructional innovations. 

These revisions will position AI literacy as a core expectation for new teachers, not simply as an optional specialization. 

Component 3 – Professional development and micro credentials for SLPS teachers 

Activities include: 

Designing a PD framework with three levels: 

Level 1: AI Literacy for All Teachers – introductory workshops on AI concepts, responsible use, and classroom implications, open to teachers in all subjects. 

Level 2: Integrating AI and Computational Thinking Across the Curriculum – deeper sessions for teachers who wish to embed computational thinking and AI related activities into mathematics, science, social studies, ELA, and other courses. 

Level 3: Computer Science and AI Specialist Preparation – intensive training for teachers who will teach dual credit computer science and AI courses, including content deepening, pedagogy, and assessment. 

Delivering summer institutes at UMSL and during the academic year in SLPS, with follow up coaching and communities of practice. 

Developing micro credentials that recognize completion of these PD sequences. These micro credentials will be jointly branded by UMSL and SLPS and will be designed to articulate into graduate credit or endorsement pathways where possible. 

Prioritizing recruitment and support of teachers from high need schools and from backgrounds underrepresented in computer science. 

Quality controls will include clearly articulated competency frameworks for each micro credential, evidence based assessments of teacher learning, and participant feedback used to refine PD offerings. 

Component 4 – Student advising, work based learning, and talent pathway alignment 

Activities include: 

Constructing visual pathway maps that show how dual credit courses count toward specific UMSL majors and minors, and how those programs connect to regional AI related occupations and in demand industry sectors. 

Training SLPS counselors, college advisers, and teachers to use these maps in advising conversations with students and families. 

Establishing partnerships with regional employers in technology, healthcare, financial services, logistics, and advanced manufacturing to provide: 

Guest lectures and classroom talks. 

Virtual and in person site visits. 

Mentoring and job shadowing opportunities. 

Project based learning experiences connected to real AI applications. 

Exploring alignment with emerging state or regional talent marketplace initiatives, including the use of Learning and Employment Records, credential registries, and skill based job descriptions. This alignment will help students translate their coursework and micro credentials into portable records of competency. 

B.4. Quality controls, continuous improvement, and replication (Criterion B.3) 

The project is explicitly designed as a continuous improvement effort. 

Each core component will have clearly defined implementation benchmarks, such as number of courses approved, teachers trained, students enrolled, and partnerships established. 

Data from the evaluation will be used to identify where implementation is strong and where additional support or redesign is needed. For instance, if pass rates differ substantially across schools, the project will examine instructional practices, student supports, and scheduling structures to understand the causes. 

Annual “learning summits” involving UMSL faculty, SLPS educators, students, and employer partners will be held to review data, reflect on progress, and adjust strategies. 

Replication is planned from the outset. Curricular materials, PD frameworks, pathway maps, and evaluation tools will be openly licensed, with guidance documents that describe conditions for effective implementation. The project team will prepare implementation briefs and present findings at relevant state and national convenings to assist other IHE–LEA partnerships in adopting similar models.
